Growl Bindings
==============

This is a copy of the Growl bindings that were included directly in monomac.dll in the past. Since Growl is an external application/framework, with a different release schedule than OSX, it is being moved to a separate assembly.

The current bindings are for Growl 1.2.1. For information in:
