Requirements:
=============
Growl application installed
Growl SDK to be linked in
And of course either MonoMac or Xamarin.Mac

Distributing the Growl framework:
=================================

By default the sample looks for the Growl framework installed in /Library/Frameworks

However you can also include the framework inside your own application. This will ease distribution by avoiding an extra dependency.

In this case you'll need to add a custom command for After Build:

mkdir -p ${TargetDir}/${SolutionName}.app/Contents/Frameworks; cp â€“r <LINK_TO_YOUR_GROWL_FRAMEWORK>/Frameworks/Growl.framework ${TargetDir}/${SolutionName}.app/Contents/Frameworks

Make sure you replace the <LINK_TO_YOUR_GROWL_FRAMEWORK> with the directory location where you copied the SDK frameworks.
